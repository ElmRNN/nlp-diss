STORY HIGHLIGHTS
- The couple were co-stars on "That '70s Show"
- The baby girl is named Wyatt Isabelle Kutcher
- She was born on Tuesday
(CNN) -- Call it the big tease.
We already knew "That '70s Show" co-stars Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher were parents.
The couple had a baby girl on Tuesday, People magazine reported.
Now we know the little girl's name. It appeared on Kutcher's website Thursday night along with a bunch of baby pictures.
"One of these is Mila and Ashton's baby....and her name is Wyatt."
This is where the mystery beings. Underneath are eight photos -- six different newborns, a dog and some undetermined critter.
Take your pick, one of them is the new Kutcher kid.
"Mila and I would like to welcome Wyatt Isabelle Kutcher to the world," a website post by the proud new daddy says. "May your life be filled with wonder, love, laughter, health, happiness, curiosity, and privacy.
"Can you guess which one is ours, or does it really matter? All babies are cute." Signed, "Ashton."

This guy is TV's highest-earning actor
While Kunis, 31, and Kutcher, 36, have stayed pretty quiet about their pregnancy and engagement, Kunis told W magazine in July that she was "excited about being a full-time mom." In the same feature article, Kunis revealed that her first kiss was with Kutcher while filming "That '70s Show."
After the show ended, the A-list actors followed different journeys for some time. The two rekindled their relationship in 2012 -- shortly after Kutcher separated from his then-wife, Demi Moore, and became engaged in early 2014.
This is the couple's first child together.

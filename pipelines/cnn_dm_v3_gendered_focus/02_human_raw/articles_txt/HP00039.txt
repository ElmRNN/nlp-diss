Fourteen of them face charges of human trafficking for sexual exploitation, the statement said.In 2011, Mexico City's human rights commission found there were "alarming" human trafficking figures in the sprawling metropolis.While an estimated 10,000 women were victims of human trafficking in Mexico's capital in 2010, there were only 40 investigations of the crime and three convictions in the city that year, according to a report from the organization.Since then, the country has changed its constitution to combat human trafficking. The measures make human trafficking a federal crime, punishable by up to 40 years in prison.

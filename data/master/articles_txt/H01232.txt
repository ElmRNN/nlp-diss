We already know lots about Mitt Romney – but his opinions on spiders, centurions from East Asia and ice picks have so far remained a secret.
A hilarious lip dub video has been produced of the Republican presidential candidate speaking nonsense, using clips from his campaign trail.
The former Massachusetts governor appears to be talking about Winona Ryder’s guitar playing, picking apples and a statue of Madonna.

Funny: A hilarious lip dub video has been produced of GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney speaking nonsense, using clips from his campaign trail
‘I will force spiders and badgers on the enemy - and get them all to shut up,’ he appears to be saying, in the video by BadLipReading.
The producers have also made lip dub videos for GOP candidates Texas Governor Rick Perry and Minnesota Representative Michele Bachmann.
The voice of Mr Romney sings in the video: ‘In America, we have a song - ding, dong, llama-wanee, jumping with an ice pick, she thinks I’m going in.’
He also appears to be saying, even more bizarrely: ‘I will force spiders and badgers on the enemy - and get them all to shut up.’

BadLipReading uses videos of politicians and singers and then puts its own lyrics over the top of them, resulting in hilarious final products.

‘We had pork chops and beans, and put it in the freezer and it rotted after a month,’ he appears to say in another clip in the two-minute video.
The video gets even random later, as he says: ‘Centurions from East Asia near Mumbai got my cooler and they took my spider jars into prison.’
Mr Romney is one of the frontrunners for the 2012 race, but faces stiff competition from Governor Perry and businessman Herman Cain.
